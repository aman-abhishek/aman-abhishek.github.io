Hi, I am a PhD student at the [School of Journalism & Mass Communication](https://journalism.wisc.edu/staff/abhishek-aman/) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, USA. 

I moved to Madison, Wisconsin to pursue a PhD in physics at University of Wisconsin-Madison after getting my bachelor's and master's degree in physics from the Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee, India. Back then, I was working in the field of particle physics, which seeks to understand the properties of the smallest particles in the Universe and the nature of the interactions between them. During my master's degree I worked at [CERN](https://home.cern/about), contributing in a [small way](https://cds.cern.ch/record/1748469?ln=en) to understand the properties of the newly discovered Higg's Boson. At Wisconsin, I worked very briefly with the [IceCube](https://icecube.wisc.edu/) detector located at the South Pole which gathers data on an elusive fundamental particle called neutrino.

After joining the physics PhD program in Madison, I started thinking about where my career is headed, and how I feel unsettled about my work not having any direct social relevance. After two years of thinking and exploring, I decided to switch to the PhD program in journalism and mass communication.

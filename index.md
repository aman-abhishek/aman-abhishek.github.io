Hi, I am a first year graduate student at the School of Journalism & Mass Communication at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

I moved to Madison, Wisconsin in 2015 to purse a PhD degree in physics at University of Wisconsin-Madison after getting my bachelor's and master's degree in physics from the Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee, India. Back then, I was working in the field of particle physics, which seeks to understand the properties of the smallest particles in nature as well as the nature of the interaction between them. During my masters I worked at [CERN](https://home.cern/about), contributing in a [small](https://cds.cern.ch/record/1748469/files/ProjectReport.pdf) way to understand the properties of the newly discovered Higg's Boson, perhaps better known as the _God Particle_. At Wisconsin, I worked with the [IceCube](https://icecube.wisc.edu/) experiment which is a detector located at the South Pole and is trying to gather data on an elusive particle called neutrino.

Social sciences had interested me since the beginning, but back in high school I had to choose either social science or natural sciences to pursue - which speaks volumes about how the education system forcibly compartmentalizes interests, and as some say, kills creativity. After joining the physics PhD program in Madison, I started thinking about where my career is headed, and what I feel about my work not having any social relevance. In 2017 I decided to change fields and pursue a PhD in media studies where I can devote more time to understanding the society that we live in.

My current research pertains to understanding social media; specifically, polarization, network formation, information spreading, and online political expression.

## Radio 

I write news stories for the show *World View* on [WORT 89.9 FM](https://www.wortfm.org/). WORT is a local, community-run, non-profit radio station. *World View* is the oldest news show on WORT, and it features a half-hour round-up of the weekâ€™s international news, followed by a 20-30 minute feature, often a speech or in-depth interview. It is broadcasted on Sundays, 5 PM CST.

Below are the recordings of the episodes of *World View* that I have contributed to. Although I try to update this list regularly, you can stream the [WORT archives](http://archive.wortfm.org/), or listen to the station [live](https://www.wortfm.org/listen-live/) on WORT website.
